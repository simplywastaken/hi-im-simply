Something fun for me to do,
though what you see may not be true.
What you find will reveal things uncoiled,
so please don't look. Don't be spoiled.

Straightforward/Non-cryptic translation:
```
Made this because I was bored and wanted to make a website thing. Later decided to include a short puzzle-esque thing hidden in the FAQ section of the page. Because of how GitHub works (to my knowledge, given my newness to GitHub I may be wrong) I *have* to make it open source, meaning you can very easily solve the puzzle just by looking at the source code/file structure.
